cycle detection for an undirected graph
I don't have a Linux machine, so the solution runs on a Windows-based Visual Studio C++ Console. It should compile and run without issues using gcc on Linux (a single file, no need for Cmakelist/Makefile :)) 

The solution is inspired by the article at GeeksforGeeks on detecting cycles in an undirected graph, utilizing the DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-undirected-graph/

Comments have been added for every implementation detail in the source code.
